package extract.types

Contains the reaction abstract class and any reactions that have been added.
ReactionAdder can be used to add new reactions, assuming the new column contents have been added.
If not Reaction Adder will still make the basic framework that can be used

If a reaction is added and you want to use it, add the reaction instance to the allReaction array in Reaction.java
