Index Card Writer- 
Send the reaction type into the index card writer. 
Reaction classes will now need a method that writes a small part of the index card.
Looking at the index card, the only fields that need to be reaction dependent are-
	 the features array in the participants
	 the interaction type
	 the modifications array and its contents
	 
Everything else could remain essentially the same although the fold part in evidence would be removed

This means that editing the indexCardWriter would be a relatively simple method that could just take the current
Json and write the remaining info that is needed by the cards.
The class that writes those parts could be an abstract class for a collection of reactions (PTMS,Mutations,etc)

Index Card -
Needs slight edits where it adds the fold column. 
That can be fixed fairly easily and could be reaction dependant as well.
