One such protein recruited to the activated receptor complex is the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, Src, which is involved in both initiation and termination of further signaling events. To gain a further understanding of the tyrosine phosphorylation events that occur during FGF signaling, with a specific focus on those that are dependent on Src family kinase (SFK) activity, we have applied SILAC combined with chemical inhibition of SFK activity to search for phosphorylation events that are dependent on SFK activity in FGF stimulated cells. In addition, we used a more targeted approach to carry out high coverage phosphopeptide mapping of one Src substrate protein, the multifunctional adaptor Dok1, and to identify SFK-dependent Dok1 binding partners. From these analyses we identify 80 SFK-dependent phosphorylation events on 40 proteins.

Given the complexity of the starting sample (mouse whole cell lysate) and the variability introduced during the phosphotyrosine IP and phosphopeptide enrichment steps, we expected considerable variation between experiments. The overlap between the four experiments is shown in Figure S1 (<xref rid="si1" ref-type="notes">Supporting Information</xref>): 50% of the phosphotyrosine peptides were identified in 2 or more experiments, while 30% were identified in 3 or more experiments. A total of 131 unique tyrosine phosphorylation sites were identified from 63 distinct proteins. Of the total 131 phosphotyrosine sites, 6 (5%) are novel, unpublished sites according to the PhosphoSitePlus database at <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://www.phosphosite.org">www.phosphosite.org</uri>.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>)</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Representative mass spectra for identification and site localization of tyrosine phosphorylation.

The three experiments utilizing both arginine and lysine SILAC labels gave a total of 433 phosphopeptide identifications, of which 303 were tyrosine phosphorylated and were assigned a SILAC ratio (Supplementary Table S2, <xref rid="si1" ref-type="notes">Supporting Information</xref>).

Several of the SFK-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation sites identified are on proteins known to be regulated by Src, including BAIP2, ZO1, paxillin, caveolin, Dok1, EGFR, Eps8, STAM2, cortactin, FAK1, PDGFR&#x003b1;, p130Cas, p120 catenin, tensin, PLC&#x003b3;, and SHIP2.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref></sup> This validates the strength of our approach for identifying Src-targets. For many of these proteins, the specific site(s) of tyrosine phosphorylation have not been previously identified as SFK phosphorylation sites according to the Human Protein Reference Database.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>) Furthermore, our data agrees with previous phosphoproteomic studies that have examined the phosphotyrosine peptide profile in 3T3 mouse fibroblasts expressing a constitutively active Src mutant, SrcY529F<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref></sup> in that we identify several Src-dependent phosphotyrosine sites that were also frequently identified in these Src-transformed cells.

are involved in events such as transcription, splicing, DNA replication and nucleic acid metabolism. Although Dok1 is predominantly a cytoplasmic/membrane protein, it has also been shown that a proportion of it is found in the nucleus.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref50">50</xref>) The function of Dok1 in the nucleus has not yet been determined, but it may be that these nuclear proteins are linked to its nuclear function. Alternatively, these nuclear proteins may be binding nonspecifically to overexpressed Dok1.</p><p>Dok1 is known to function as an adaptor protein in insulin signaling and has recently been shown to have a role in energy metabolism, mediating adipocyte hypertrophy and obesity through modulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor- &#x003b3; (PPAR-&#x003b3;) phosphorylation.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref55">55</xref>) PPAR-&#x003b3; is a nuclear receptor that mediates the metabolism of fatty acids and induces genes related to fatty acid metabolism. Antagonising PPAR-&#x003b3; has been shown to result in a decrease in peroxiredoxin.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref56">56</xref>) Interestingly, we identified enriched fatty acid synthase (FAS), peroxiredoxin-1 (PRDX-1) and peroxiredoxin-2 (PRDX-2) as putative Dok1 interactors. It is tempting to speculate that these proteins may link Dok1 to PPAR- &#x003b3; and their role in energy metabolism.</p><p>The Dok1 SILAC experiment in the presence and absence of SU6656, allowed us to identify Dok1 binding partners whose interaction with Dok1 was regulated by SFKs. A total of 341 proteins were identified (&#x0003c;1% FDR) (Supplementary Table S4, <xref rid="si1" ref-type="notes">Supporting Information</xref>). The Dok1 protein itself had a SILAC ratio of 1.05 (heavy/light, where heavy was SU6656-treated). Of the known binding partners of Dok1, PLC&#x003b3;1 and NCK2 were significantly enriched in the SU6656-treated cells, with SILAC ratios of 2.04 and 2.30, respectively (Table <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). The enrichment of PLC&#x003b3;1 and NCK2 in the SU6656 treated cells indicates that the inhibition of SFK activity, and thus phosphorylation events mediated by SFKs, has caused an increase in the amount of these proteins bound to Dok1. RasGAP and Csk were not significantly enriched in either cell population (with SILAC ratios of 0.82 and 1.24, respectively), suggesting that these interactions are not SFK-dependent.</p><table-wrap

myc-Dok1 vs untransfected SILAC experiment was checked in order to see whether they may be a contaminant. Where a protein was not significantly enriched in the myc-Dok1 vs untransfected IP (Table <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">3</xref>), the protein was considered a contaminant and removed from the final list (nine proteins). Table <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">4</xref> shows the remaining 14 proteins that were significantly enriched in the SU6656 treated cells and the 4 proteins that were enriched in the non-SU6656 treated cells. A number of proteins are absent in the myc-Dok1 vs untransfected SILAC experiment (Table <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). In these cases, the possibility remains that the protein may not be a true Dok1 interacting partner, an important consideration when selecting proteins for further biological analysis.</p><p>The shuttling of Dok1 between the nucleus and cytoplasm has been shown to be dependent on Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref50">50</xref>) Phosphorylation of Dok1 by Src causes accumulation of Dok1 in the cytoplasm, assumed to be caused by an inhibition of nuclear import.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref50">50</xref>) Interestingly, our data shows that, in the presence of the SFK inhibitor, SU6656, Dok1 bound to more nuclear proteins than in the absence of SU6656. The inhibition of nuclear import due to Src-phosphorylation is presumably due to a lack of interaction with nuclear import transporters. Our data shows an increased amount of Dok1-bound transportin-1, a nuclear import protein, in the absence of Src-induced phosphorylation, consistent with Src-dependent inhibition of nuclear import. However, we note that transportin-1 was not identified as a Dok1-binding protein in the previous experiment; therefore, we cannot be certain that this is a true Dok1 interactor.</p><p>IRS4 and SHIP2 were also found enriched in SU6656 treated cells, suggesting that they may bind to Dok1 directly or indirectly in a SFK-dependent manner. Dok1 has not previously been linked to either protein, although all three proteins play a role in insulin signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref58">58</xref></sup> and both IRS4 and SHIP2 play a role in FGF/FGFR signaling.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>) Although a direct link between Dok1 and IRS4 has not been previously reported, IRS4 is known to interact with CRKL, which is also a known binding partner of Dok1.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref59">59</xref>) The quantitative proteomics approach described here has not only identified additional putative, binding partners of Dok1 but has also provided information about the regulation of these interactions by SFKs. Future studies will be needed to investigate the role of the novel SFK-dependent phosphorylation sites in these interactions.</p></sec></sec><!--with a head--><sec id="sec4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We have implemented a differential phosphoproteomics approach for dissection of the SFK-mediated interaction network within the FGF signaling pathway. We have focused on those phosphorylation sites which are dependent on activation of SFK activity and then on Dok1, with the identification of both SFK-dependent and independent sites of phosphorylation, and SFK-dependent Dok1 binding partners. The study has revealed the phosphorylation of multiple downstream kinases and adaptor/scaffolding proteins and has identified a significant number of proteins potentially involved in FGF signaling for further functional scrutiny. We note that the final protein-targeted step in our approach can be used to further characterize any of the proteins showing SFK-dependency that we have identified in our global analysis. Indeed, data from such experiments could be combined to provide a detailed tyrosine phosphorylation map of events occurring within the Src-mediated node of FGFR signaling. The experimental approach employed in this study is readily applicable to deeper analysis of both the FGF and other receptor tyrosine kinases.</p></sec><!--with a head--><sec id="sec5"><title>Supplementary Methods</title><!--with a head--><sec id="sec5.1"><title>Peptide and Protein Identification and Quantitation</title><!--with a head--><sec id="sec5.1.1"><title>Antiphosphotyrosine IP (SILAC)</title><p>Fifteen raw files were analyzed by MaxQuant, 4 were following phosphopeptide enrichment (and therefore searched allowing phosphorylation as a variable modification). Eleven were either flow-throughs from enrichments or unenriched controls (therefore searched without allowing phosphorylation). Three experiments (13 raw files) employed Lys6, Arg10 labels, while one experiment employed only Lys6 label (2 raw files). All 15 files were combined in the &#x02018;Identify&#x02019; step. An experimental design template was used to mark raw files as being from experiment 1, 2, 3, or 4 and also to indicate that the labeling in experiment 3 was inverted. Identifications were filtered using a peptide FDR of 0.01 and a protein FDR of 1.00 (no filtering at the protein level). Supplementary Table S1 (<xref rid="si1" ref-type="notes">Supporting Information</xref>) was created from the evidence.txt output for all four experiments, by sorting according to phospho (Y) site ID. Supplementary Table S2 (<xref rid="si1" ref-type="notes">Supporting Information</xref>) was created from the evidence.txt output for all dual labeled experiments, by sorting according to phospho (Y) site ID and SILAC ratio. Reverse hits and contaminants are not shown. All ratios obtained from MaxQuant were adjusted using a correction factor to allow for mixing error. This correction factor was calculated by combining all unenriched pre-IP control samples and normalizing peptide ratios so that the median of their logarithms is zero. In order to calculate the probability cut-offs (<italic>p</italic> = 0.05), the value for 2 &#x000d7; the standard deviation of the control ratio logarithms was calculated. Ratios were deemed significantly changed if they were &#x0003c;0.616 or &#x0003e;1.624. The correction factor was then applied to the enriched samples, and the means of the corrected ratio logarithms for each peptide were calculated. Variability (%) was calculated using the standard deviation of the natural logarithms of the SILAC ratios, multiplied by 100.</p></sec><!--with a head--><sec id="sec5.1.2"><title>Myc-Dok1 IP Plus/Minus Src Drug (SILAC)</title><p>Two separate experiments were carried out, resulting in 41 raw files.
