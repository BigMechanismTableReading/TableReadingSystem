The CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling axis has been implicated in both cancer metastases and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection and a more complete understanding of CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling pathways may support efforts to develop therapeutics for these diseases. Mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics has emerged as an important tool in studying signaling networks in an unbiased fashion. We employed stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) quantitative phosphoproteomics to examine the CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling axis in the human lymphoblastic CEM cell line. We quantified 4,074 unique SILAC pairs from 1,673 proteins and 89 phosphopeptides were deemed CXCL12-responsive in biological replicates. Several well established CXCL12-responsive phosphosites such as AKT (pS473) and ERK2 (pY204) were confirmed in our study. We also validated two novel CXCL12-responsive phosphosites, stathmin (pS16) and AKT1S1 (pT246) by Western blot. Pathway analysis and comparisons with other phosphoproteomic datasets revealed that genes from CXCL12-responsive phosphosites are enriched for cellular pathways such as T cell activation, epidermal growth factor and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, pathways which have previously been linked to CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling. Several of the novel CXCL12-responsive phosphoproteins from our study have also been implicated with cellular migration and HIV-1 infection, thus providing an attractive list of potential targets for the development of cancer metastasis and HIV-1 therapeutics and for furthering our understanding of chemokine signaling regulation by reversible phosphorylation.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chemokines are small (8&#x02013;12 kDa) extracellular mediators of inflammation, chemotaxis, development and cellular survival.

Cells were grown in parallel in media containing lysine and arginine labeled with the nonradioactive heavy isotopes of <sup>13</sup>C and <sup>15</sup>N (&#x02018;heavy&#x02019; media) or in normal media containing natural lysine and arginine isotopes (&#x02018;light&#x02019; media). The mass difference between heavy and light peptides allows for sensitive measurement by the mass spectrometer of the relative abundance of a peptide between experimental samples. Aliquots of heavy and light cultures of CEM cells were either left untreated or stimulated with 10 ng/mL of CXCL12 for 5 min at 37&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024918-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Small aliquots were taken from each experimental sample before processing to confirm CXCL12 signaling activity by probing for pERK1/2 by Western blot (data not shown). Lysates of CXCL12-treated heavy cells were mixed with lysates from untreated light cells and conversely, lysates of CXCL12-treated light cells were mixed with lysates of untreated heavy cells. One heavy-stimulated sample pair (HS) was analyzed, as were two light-stimulated sample pairs, LS1 and LS2. In addition, LS1 was split into two aliquots that were each analyzed independently by mass spectrometry providing a pair of technical replicates termed LS1a and LS1b.

First, the change in phosphopeptide abundance upon CXCL12 addition must be increased or decreased by &#x02265;1.5-fold. Second, a phosphopeptide must be consistently regulated in two or more biological replicates - the HS sample and any two of the LS1a, LS1b or LS2 samples. While both heavy and light stimulations have not been routinely included in published quantitative phosphoproteomics studies, this criterion reduces potential false positives resulting merely from CXCL12-independent differences in peptide abundances between the heavy and light cells. We reasoned that phosphosites that are strongly regulated by CXCL12 would be detected in biological replicates regardless of potential variations due to heavy and light media preparations or due to biological variability.</p><p>Compared to unphosphorylated peptides, 11.0&#x000b1;2.5 (mean &#x000b1; STD) times more phosphopeptides increased in abundance &#x02265;1.5-fold upon CXCL12 treatment, indicating a good degree of specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024918-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). This is consistent with the fact that cells were treated with CXCL12 for only 5 min - enough time for changes in phosphorylation via CXCR4-dependent signaling, but not enough time for many proteins to change in overall abundance due to either degradation or enhanced protein synthesis. Ratios of protein abundance can also be derived through quantification of several unphosphorylated peptides from the same protein. Using this approach, we found that only one out of 3,187 proteins consistently changed in abundance more than 1.5-fold in biological replicates. In contrast, 89 phosphopeptides from 81 proteins consistently changed in abundance by at least 1.5-fold between any pair of biological replicates. Mass spectrometry details of these phosphopeptides are included in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0024918.s002">Table S2</xref>. In addition, some phosphopeptides exhibited variable changes in abundance between biological replicates, increasing by &#x02265;1.5-fold in at least one sample while decreasing by &#x02265;1.5-fold in another, as has been reported by others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024918-Seyfried1">[45]</xref>. Such differences may be due to CXCL12-independent differences in phosphopeptide abundance between the heavy and light cell populations, perhaps linked to the fact that these cells were propagated independently for about two weeks. To test this possibility, we treated independent cultures of CEM cells with CXCL12 as before and probed by Western blot with antibodies specific for PLK (pT210) and PBK (pT9), both of which appeared up-regulated in at least one light-stimulated sample, yet were down-regulated in the heavy-stimulated sample. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024918-g003">Figure 3C</xref>, these phosphosites were unresponsive to CXCL12 and so may have had unequal abundances in the heavy and light cell populations.</p><fig id="pone-0024918-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0024918.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Validation of phosphosites detected by mass spectrometer.</title><p>CEM cells were treated with 10 ng/mL of CXCL12 for 5 min and lysates analyzed by Western blot using antibodies for (A) stathmin (pS16), total stathmin, AKT1S1 (pT246), total AKT1S1, (B) CDK1 (pY15), tubulin, Rb (pS795), total Rb (C) PLK1 (pT210), PBK (pT9), and tubulin by Western blot.

Christensen et al. stimulated 293T cells with angiotensin II (Ang II) or [Sar<sup>1</sup>, Ile<sup>4</sup>, Ile<sup>8</sup>] angiotensin II (SII-Ang II), both of which bind to and signal through the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024918-Christensen1">[44]</xref>.

Since the overlap of CXCL12-responsive phosphosites and corresponding genes with the G protein-dependent phosphosites identified by Chrisensen was highly significant, we conclude that our dataset faithfully reflects G protein-dependent CXCL12-mediated signal transduction pathways.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the present study, we successfully measured the fold-change in abundance of 4,074 phosphopeptides CEM cells, 89 of which consistently changed in abundance upon CXCL12 addition in biological replicates. Several independent lines of evidence suggest that these CXCL12-responsive phosphosites faithfully reflect CXCL12 signaling events. First, Western blot analysis of several phosphoproteins confirmed their respective SILAC ratios. Stathmin (pS16) and AKT1S1 (pT246), both novel CXCL12-responsive phosphosites, increased in abundance upon CXCL12 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024918-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). In contrast, Rb (pS795) and CDK1 (pY15) did not change when analyzed by Western blot, confirming the SILAC ratios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024918-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0024918-t002">Table 2</xref>). Second, cellular pathways that are known to be involved in CXCL12 signaling were significantly enriched in our dataset. These include T cell activation, EGF signaling and mTOR (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0024918-t003">Table 3</xref>). We were further able to confirm these associations by measuring the overlap of genes from other published independent phosphoproteomic datasets examining these pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024918-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Lastly, a comparison of our dataset with phosphosites from a recently published phosphoproteomic study examining G protein biased ligands confirms that CXCL12-responsive phosphosites reflect G protein-dependent signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024918-Rubin1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024918-Christensen1">[44]</xref>, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024918-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Biochemical and bioinformatic analyses complemented with literature mining all reinforce the association of our dataset with known CXCL12-dependent signaling pathways.</p><p>The results from this study expand not only the ever-growing list of catalogued phosphosites - over 1,700 of the phosphopeptides we detected are novel &#x02013; but also provide a unique resource for the advancing the study of biological processes that are regulated by CXCR4. Only 34 of the 81 genes from our dataset are annotated in the KEGG pathway database, thus providing an opportunity to expand our understanding of these cellular pathway with the knowledge that a given gene product is differentially phosphophorylated by CXCL12. In addition, potential functions for a majority of CXCL12-regulated phosphosites have not yet been defined. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024918-g005">Figure 5</xref> shows all genes from CXCL12-responsive phosphosites according to published putative functions.</p><fig id="pone-0024918-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0024918.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Compilation of genes from CXCL12-responsive phosphosites.</title><p>Putative cellular localizations and functions of each gene are indicated as described in the literature.

PLK (pT210) and PBK (pT9) decreased &#x02265;1.5-fold in the heavy-treated cells yet increased &#x02265;1.5-fold in at least one of the light treated samples (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0024918-t002">Table 2</xref>). The most likely explanation for these inverted ratios is that these phosphosites are not CXCL12-responsive and had unequal abundances in the heavy and light cell mixtures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024918-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). To control for inherent differences in phosphosite abundance between heavy and light cultures that would otherwise contribute to false positives, one can either include a mixture of untreated heavy and light populations or stimulate each and combine with the untreated pair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024918-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). The latter strategy is often referred to as a &#x02018;swap&#x02019; or &#x02018;reverse labeling&#x02019; and phosphopeptides are only considered if the heavy- and light-treated SILAC ratios are not inverted. An added benefit to this approach is that a genuine biological replicate is obtained concurrently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024918-Cumming1">[58]</xref>. A drawback is that inverted heavy and light ratios can be due to either inherently different phosphopeptide abundances or biological noise. When comparing pairs of light-treated samples, LS1a, LS1b, and LS2, very few (0.08&#x02013;0.4&#x00025;) of each pair's SILAC ratios (&#x02265;1.5-fold) were inverted, suggesting that biological noise was not a major factor.</p><p>One of the phosphosites we validated in our screen, stathmin (pS16), has not been previously shown to be regulated by CXCL12.

While few studies have examined the regulation of microtubules by chemokines, it is known that CXCL12 leads to the microtubule-dependent polarization of CEM cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024918-Takesono1">[59]</xref>. Indeed, several other genes from CXCL12-responsive phosphosites identified in our study are known to regulate the microtubule cytoskeleton, including CLIP-170 (pS348), EB1 (pS165), CEP170 (pS496) and EML3 (pS176), none of which have previously been shown to be influenced by CXCL12 signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024918-Galjart1">[60]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024918-Slep1">[61]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024918-Guarguaglini1">[62]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024918-TeghaDunghu1">[63]</xref>.

While the role of the human EB1 (pS165) phosphosite has not been elucidated, a small cluster of phosphosites in the analogous linker region of the yeast homolog, Bim1p, was recently shown to regulate the association of Bim1p with microtubules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024918-Zimniak1">[65]</xref>. Taken together, our data indicate that CXCL12 signaling via CXCR4 leads to rapid phosphorylation of a number of proteins involved in microtubule dynamics, suggesting a direct role in regulating the cellular cytoskeleton for subsequent chemotaxis or some other functional response.</p><p>CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling has become increasingly implicated with various human cancers.

Also, genes from M-phase responsive phosphopeptides were not enriched in our dataset (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.073) nor were genes from a manually curated collection of cancer related genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024918-Dephoure1">[68]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024918-Futreal1">[69]</xref> (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.20) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024918-g004">Figure 4A</xref>).

From our dataset, RICTOR contains two CXCL12-responsive phosphosites, pS1282 and pS1302.

In total, 23 of the 78 genes in our dataset have a documented role in HIV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024918-g005">Figure 5</xref>), several of which have diverse roles in HIV infection.

Little is known of the roles of phosphorylation or CXCR4 signaling on the activity of these proteins, yet HIV may modulate the activity of these proteins in a CXCR4-dependent manner to facilitate infection of the target cell. This is certainly plausible since it has already been demonstrated that cellular signals transduced by HIV during entry can affect multiple stages of the HIV lifecycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024918-BarreroVillar1">[79]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024918-Yoder1">[80]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024918-Gringhuis1">[81]</xref>.

Future studies can also address potential differences between signaling of CXCR4 and CCR5, another HIV-1 coreceptor, since differential engagement of these chemokine receptors can have unique effects on target gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024918-Cicala1">[86]</xref> and host factor requirements for infection of primary cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0024918-Jones1">[87]</xref>.

We confirmed associations with various signaling pathways that have already been described, e.g. T cell activation, EGF, and mTOR, and highlighted perhaps under-appreciated associations such as with microtubule dynamics.
